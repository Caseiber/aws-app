# aws-app

This is a simple project to get some experience building a full app with AWS.

It is based off of the tutorial found here: https://youtu.be/7m_q1ldzw0U

I have adapted the tutorial so that the lambda function is deployed using Golang, instead of Python

The finished app can be found [here](https://dev8651.d3uboll7eprckv.amplifyapp.com/)
